## About

This project is an application that lists timetables for different cities around the world. The user types the name of the city and it is added to this list, showing the time in each location simultaneously. In companies with teams allocated in several countries, this type of functionality is very useful. The list of cities is obtained by the City Timezones library, which converts the name of the city typed by the user into the respective timezone. Each time corresponding to a timezone is obtained by the React Live Clock library. Some Bootstrap components for input field are also used.

### Technologies

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [React Live Clock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-live-clock)
- [City Timezones](https://www.npmjs.com/package/city-timezones)
- [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
